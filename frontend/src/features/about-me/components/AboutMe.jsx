      <p>
        My name is Maha Uddin — I’m a proud Detroiter, technologist, and student dedicated to building a more inclusive future in STEM.
        <br /><br />
        With a 4.0 GPA in the Computer Information Systems curriculum at Cass Tech, I’ve combined academic rigor with real-world innovation. I serve as the President of SkillsUSA, leading over 100 students in technical and leadership development. I’ve represented Michigan at the Business Professionals of America National Leadership Conference and earned bronze in Internetworking while representing Detroit.
        <br /><br />
        I’m a two-time 1st Place Hackathon Champion at Accelerate4KIDS, a Simulated Stock Market winner at Ally Financial, and recently placed 3rd in the 2025 Inspire Change Student Business Challenge with the Detroit Lions, where I pitched ideas to enhance fan engagement.
        <br /><br />
        My experiences include serving as a Cybersecurity Analyst at Little Caesars Enterprises, researching post-COVID influenza trends for biomedical studies, interning as a Student Engineer at Google Code Next, and soon joining JustAir as a Software Developer to help improve environmental health outcomes through technology.
        <br /><br />
        Outside of tech, I’m a featured fashion designer through Big Sean’s nonprofit, a student announcer since 2022, and an active member of Girls Who Code, Get-IT Girls, and Robotics.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>My mission is to:</strong>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Break down systemic barriers in STEM by championing equity and representation.</li>
          <li>Use technology to build tools that help communities thrive — especially those historically excluded from innovation.</li>
          <li>Turn Detroit into a national model for youth-led tech, culture, and economic growth.</li>
          <li>Inspire students to lead, create, and own their futures through innovation, entrepreneurship, and excellence.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Tech is my tool. Justice is my goal. I’m here to build a world where access, opportunity, and creativity are limitless — no matter your gender or beginning.
