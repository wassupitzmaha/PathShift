        <b>Introduction</b> <b />

        <p>
        As an incoming college freshman, I often find myself reflecting on the likelihood that individuals will pursue careers<b/>
        related to their field of study. To address this, I have developed this interactive analysis to provide insights into this trend,<b />
        helping others gain a clearer understanding of the connections between academic majors and professional pathways.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Data Processing</b> < b/>
          <p>
          - Feature 1: For every selected major, the program counts the total number of people who majored in the field and the number of people who are employed in a occupation related to that major.
          <p>
            - Feature 2: The program then calculates and prints the percentage likelihood of sticking to the selected major.</p>

        <b>Visualizations</b>
  <p>- Type 1: Pie Chart<p />

  <p>- Type 2: Stacked Bar Chart </p>
    
  <p>- Type 3: Waffle Chart</p>
